#Task 4: Analysis:
I’ll be carrying out the analysis on a start up idea:

Overview:
It’s an application like uber eats and wolt but instead of delivering food from restaurants it will be from individuals offering home cooked meals.
Consumers often seek healthier, affordable, and homemade food alternatives to restaurant meals. Individuals who enjoy cooking at home may want to monetize their culinary skills but lack the platform to do so. This application bridges the gap by connecting home cooks with consumers seeking diverse, homemade meals.


1.Target Audience:
-Individuals who have limited to no-time to cook but prefer home made meals.
-Expats who are craving traditional food from their culture.
-Health consious individuals who are seeking healthier and customizable meal options.
-Home cooks or single Mothers/Fathers who are looking to earn extra income from the comfort of their home.

2.Key Features:
-Profiles for Home cooks including Reviews.
-Meal Types and dietry preferences (Vegan-Gluten Free-Vegeterian-etc)
-Cuisine Type.(Italian-Indian- Mideterrianen -etc)
-option for real time tracking option and eco-friendly packaging
-easy acess for saving your favorite meals and re-ordering
-seamless ordering and payment system

3-Market Analysis:
-Indirect Competitors: Traditional food delivery services like Uber Eats or Wolt.
This app differentiates itself by focusing solely on home-cooked meals.

4- Risks:
-The difficulty of implementing Hygeine precautions and inspections for home cooks.
-The diffficulty to complaint against food safety conern or issue.

5-Marketing Strategy:
-Lavergege social Media to highlight the idea.
-collaborate with food bloggers and influencers for honest reviews and promotions.
-Launch in the USA market as a first step for the availibilty of working and health consious individuals
-launch in Germany next for the high denisty of expats 

6-Legal considerations:
-ensure the food safety standards(labelling the whole ingredients in case of allergic people)
-privacy of user’s information(card-address-etc)

7-Goals:
-Promotes local cooks and promotes cultral exchange through food
-create income opportuities for individuals.
-encourage individuals towards healthier food options.

8-Future opportunities:
-partner with local farms for fresh ingrediants.
-introduce live events or workships by well known cooks.
-use AI for customized meal recommendations

9-Domain Knowledge:
-no need for knowledge and devolpment, the data already exists It needs to be gathered example: cities with high expats, cities with high health consious indiviudals.

10-Stake holders:
-Home Cooks
-end Consumers
-App Devolepors.
-Delivery individuals
